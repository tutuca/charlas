## Coroutines

>- Not a new thing: [Conway, 1963], [Knuth, 1980, Marlin 1980, ]
>- A control abstraction ditched in favor of multi-threading.
>- Having a revival due the need of higly availability services.

- “The values of data local to a coroutine persist between successive
calls”;
- “The execution of a coroutine is suspended as control leaves it, only to
carry on where


[Marlin 1980]
